    ## Here are some of the tools we're using:


    - Bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/components/

      This is some code released for free by Twitter that gives us a good 
      starting point for building applications. With Bootstrap, we can do 
      stuff like
        
        <a href="/submit" class="button">SUBMIT</a>

      and we'll get a button instead of a normal link. Plus lots of other 
      things such as tabs, tooltips, dropdown menus, modal (popup) windows, etc...



    - jQuery
      
      This helps us take actions when the user does things like clicking buttons,
      typing into boxes, etc... It does a lot of other stuff, too, and is
      actually an extremely helpful bit of code that's used by something insane
      like 80% of all websites on the internet.



    - Horse JS
      
      This is obviously the most important piece of the application.
